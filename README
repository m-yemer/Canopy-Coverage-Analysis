Hereâ€™s a simple `README.txt` file that you can include with your project, providing instructions on how to run the code:

# Tree Coverage Analysis with Heatmap

This project analyzes tree coverage in images and generates a heatmap overlay to indicate the density of tree coverage. The program allows the user to select colors representing tree canopy and non-tree areas, then processes the image to display a heatmap.

## Features:
- Select colors for tree canopy and non-tree areas.
- Divide the image into a grid to analyze tree density.
- Generate a heatmap overlay to visualize tree density in the image.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository or download the code files.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

## How to Run:
1. Place your images in a folder (e.g., `images/`).
2. In the code directory, open a terminal or command prompt and run the script:
   ```
   python tree_coverage_analysis.py
   ```
   This will process all images in the `images/` directory (you can modify this directory path in the code if needed).

3. The program will prompt you to select colors for the tree canopy and non-tree areas:
   - Click on regions in the image to select the canopy colors (you must select 4).
   - Click on regions to select the non-tree colors (you must select 3).
   - The script will automatically analyze the image and display the tree coverage heatmap.

## How to Use:
- Run the script, and it will open each image for color selection.
- After selecting the colors, the program will calculate tree density, apply a heatmap overlay, and display the results.
